Analysis 11 -

The probability of Indian Cricket Team winning in India is more than the probability of
Indian Cricket Team winning outside of India under the captainship of M.S Dhoni

Method              : Hypothesis Testing
p1                  : Proportion of Indian Cricket Team winning in India under the captainship of M.S Dhoni
p2                  : Proportion of Indian Cricket Team winning outside India under the captainship of M.S Dhoni

H0                  : p1 - p2 <= 0
H1                  : p1 - p2 > 0
Significance Level  : 5 percent

p1                           : 0.49
p2                           : 0.27
n1 (Size of I sample)        : 51
n2 (Size of II sample)       : 63
I Sample Variance            : 0.25
II Sample Variance           : 0.20
I Sample Standard Deviation  : 0.50
II Sample Standard Deviation : 0.44
Test Statistic               : z - test
Test Statistic Value         : 2.46
p - value                    : 0.007

Conclusion : Based on our p - value we can say that due to lack of evidences we reject our NULL HYPOTHESIS.
             Hence, The probability of Indian Cricket Team winning in India is more than the probability of
             Indian Cricket Team winning outside of India under the captainship of M.S Dhoni
